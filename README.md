# Exploring Kubernetes

**From first deployment to production operations.**

A progressive learning site for Kubernetes—from application developer deploying your first app to platform engineer running production clusters. Built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

🌐 **Live site:** [kubernetes.bradpenney.io](https://kubernetes.bradpenney.io)

## Who This Is For

### Starting Point: Application Developer

**Day One and Level 1-2** are designed for application developers who:

- Just received `kubectl` access to their company's dev cluster
- Need to deploy an application but don't know Kubernetes yet
- May be intimidated by the command line
- Are learning because their company adopted K8s (not by choice!)
- Have a team where nobody knows Kubernetes either

**The reality:** Your company adopted Kubernetes. Your teammates are learning alongside you. This site gets you unblocked—not certified, just functional enough to deploy your code and debug when things break.

### Destination: Platform Engineer

**Level 3-6** shift to platform engineering concerns:

- Networking and security (Ingress, Network Policies, DNS)
- Storage and state management (PV, PVC, StorageClasses)
- Resource management and scheduling (Requests, Limits, Affinity)
- Production operations and observability (Logging, Monitoring, Helm)

By Level 6, you'll be running production Kubernetes clusters with confidence.

### Day One - Getting Started

**For:** Application developers with kubectl access to a real cluster

**Goal:** Deploy your first application successfully and understand what you're doing

**Articles:**
- What Is Kubernetes? ✅
- Getting kubectl Access *(coming soon)*
- Your First Deployment *(coming soon)*
- Essential kubectl Commands *(coming soon)*
- Understanding What Happened *(coming soon)*

### Level 1 - Core Primitives *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** App developers getting comfortable

**Topics:** Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Namespaces, Labels & Selectors

### Level 2 - Workload Management *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** App developers deploying real applications

**Topics:** Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs & CronJobs

### Level 3 - Networking *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** App developers + Platform engineers

**Topics:** Services Deep Dive, Ingress, Network Policies, DNS, Troubleshooting

### Level 4 - Storage and State *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** Both personas, stateful applications

**Topics:** Volumes, Persistent Volumes, StorageClasses, Databases on K8s

### Level 5 - Advanced Scheduling & Security *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** Platform engineers

**Topics:** Resource Requests/Limits, Taints & Tolerations, Affinity, RBAC, Security

### Level 6 - Production Operations *(Coming Soon)*

**For:** SREs and platform engineers

**Topics:** Logging, Monitoring, Health Checks, Helm, Operators

## Philosophy

### 🛡️ Production Safety

Real-world scenarios you'll encounter with actual clusters. Learn when commands are dangerous and why. Safety-first approach throughout.

### 💡 Purpose-Driven Learning

Understand the "why," not just memorize YAML. Every resource type, every command—you'll know why it exists and when to use it.

### 📈 Progressive Complexity

From Day One deployment to production operations. Start as an intimidated app developer, become a confident platform engineer.

### 👥 Dual Personas

Serving both application developers (Day One - Level 2) AND platform engineers (Level 3-6). The content meets you where you are.

## What Makes This Different

This site takes a unique approach to teaching Kubernetes:

- **Assumes real cluster access** — You already have kubectl credentials, skip the local setup
- **Starts with deployment** — Get working first, understand architecture later
- **Acknowledges the reality** — Your team is figuring this out together, you're not alone
- **Builds confidence gradually** — Read-only commands first, then move to changes
- **Progressive personas** — Start as app developer, grow into platform engineer
- **Production safety throughout** — Namespace awareness, command labels, safety-first approach

## Tech Stack

- **[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)** - Documentation site generator
- **Python 3.12+** - Runtime
- **Poetry** - Dependency management
- **Markdown** - Content format with extensions for tabs, admonitions, diagrams

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Serve locally (http://localhost:8000)
poetry run mkdocs serve

# Build static site
poetry run mkdocs build --strict
```

The `--strict` flag validates all internal links and fails the build on errors.
