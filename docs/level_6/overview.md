# Level 6: Production Operations

!!! tip "Running Kubernetes at Scale"
    Your cluster is secure, resources are managed, and workloads are scheduled correctly. Now learn how to observe, maintain, and operate Kubernetes in production.

## What You'll Master

Level 6 teaches **production operations**—the skills SREs and platform engineers need daily:

- **Logging Architecture** - Container logs, cluster logs, log aggregation strategies
- **Monitoring and Metrics** - Metrics server, Prometheus, Grafana, alerting
- **Health Checks and Probes** - Liveness, readiness, startup probes, graceful shutdown
- **Helm Package Manager** - Charts, releases, repositories, templating, best practices
- **Operators and Custom Resources** - CRDs, operator pattern, ecosystem

This is **SRE and platform operations**—keeping production Kubernetes running reliably.

## Who This Is For

**You are:**
- An SRE or platform engineer running production Kubernetes
- Responsible for observability, alerting, and incident response
- Looking to package and distribute applications with Helm
- Interested in extending Kubernetes with custom resources

**You'll learn:**
- How to aggregate logs from thousands of pods
- How to monitor cluster and application health
- How to implement health checks that actually work
- How to package applications for repeatable deployment
- How to extend Kubernetes with custom functionality

---

## The Operations Mindset

Level 6 is about **keeping production running** at scale:

**Questions you'll be able to answer:**
- Why is this pod crashing? (logging)
- Is the cluster healthy? (monitoring)
- Should traffic be routed to this pod? (probes)
- How do we deploy this app consistently across environments? (Helm)
- Can we extend Kubernetes for our specific needs? (operators)

These are the **day-to-day concerns of production Kubernetes operations**.

## The Journey Complete

By the end of Level 6, you've gone from:

- **Day One:** "What is Kubernetes and how do I deploy my app?"
- **Level 1-2:** "How do I work with Kubernetes resources?"
- **Level 3-4:** "How do I connect services and persist data?"
- **Level 5:** "How do I make this production-ready?"
- **Level 6:** "How do I operate this at scale?"

You've completed the journey from **application developer to platform engineer**.

---

## Beyond Level 6

There's always more to learn:

- **Service Meshes** (Istio, Linkerd) for advanced traffic management
- **GitOps** (ArgoCD, Flux) for declarative cluster management
- **Multi-Cluster Management** for complex topologies
- **Cost Optimization** and efficiency improvements
- **Advanced Operators** for complex stateful applications

But Level 6 gives you the foundation to explore any of these confidently.

## What's Next?

You've reached the end of the structured learning path. From here:

- **Apply your knowledge** - Run production Kubernetes clusters
- **Contribute back** - Share what you've learned with your team
- **Keep learning** - The Kubernetes ecosystem evolves constantly
- **Specialize** - Find the areas that interest you most and go deep

Congratulations on completing the journey from Day One to production operations.
