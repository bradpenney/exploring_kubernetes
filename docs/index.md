# Welcome to Exploring Kubernetes

A subsection of [BradPenney.io](https://bradpenney.io), this is a hands-on, human-friendly
dive into the ever-evolving world of containers, clusters, and cloud-native wizardry! ☸️🚀

This site is dedicated to documenting the best practices, hidden gems, and everyday challenges
of working with Kubernetes. From managing workloads to taming YAML, I’ll share what I learn
(and occasionally break) along the way.

Whether you're spinning up your first Pod or wrangling Kustomize like a boss, I hope you’ll
find something useful, practical, or at least entertaining here. 😄

## Topics to Explore 🔍

- Core concepts: Pods, Deployments, Services, and beyond 🧱
- Helm, Kustomize, and managing complex configs 🎛️
- Tips, tools, and CLI tricks for cluster sanity 🧘
- Real-world scenarios, diagrams, and troubleshooting tales 🧯

Stay tuned as I keep exploring the cloudy frontier of Kubernetes.
Thanks for stopping by — and may your clusters stay healthy! 👋
